This extensions adds a video local hosted preview to videos that has been
embedded with fluid_styled_content (e.g. Text & Media content element) to the
frontend. All the third party stuff will only be loaded/embedded if the user
clicks on the preview image to view the video which helps in case of
performance and providing more privacy for your website users.
